# Echo-matic
The Echo-matic is a small DIY project that enables you to use an old three-head tape deck as an analog delay.
Effectivley it is a simple mixer that takes an input, sends it to a tape deck, then retrives the signal back and re-mixes it with the original signal. It has some controls for wet/dry mix, level and echo repeats.
